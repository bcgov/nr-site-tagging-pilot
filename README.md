# BC Environment Capstone: Document Classification Pipeline

This project automates the classification, renaming, and metadata extraction of scanned site remediation documents (PDFs) provided by the BC Ministry of Environment.

---

For each PDF in the input folder:

1. Extract the **Site ID** from the filename using regex, or fall back to **LLM (Mistral via Ollama)**.
2. Use a **document classifier** to assign a type (e.g., REPORT, PSI, CORR):
   - Default: regex-based keyword matcher
   - Optional: ML-based BERT model (Hugging Face)
3. Generate a standardized filename:  
   `YYYY-MM-DD – SITE_ID – TYPE.pdf`
4. Copy the renamed file into `data/output/{TYPE}/`
5. Log extracted metadata to `logs/metadata_log.csv`
6. Optionally compare results to a gold-standard metadata CSV for validation

## Folder Setup

Your folder should look like this:

### **Directory Structure**

REQUIRED LOOKUP FILES

The following file must be placed inside the data/lookups/ directory **before running the pipeline**:

1. site_registry_mapping.xlsx
   - Purpose: Determines whether a document is publicly releasable based on its type. Avaliable on the Teams channel.
   - Columns:
     • Document_Type  
     • Site_Registry_Releaseable (values must be "yes" or "no")

2. site_ids.csv  
   - Purpose: Contains site id to address mapping.  

This file is mandatory. The pipeline will not run if it is missing. Avaliable on the Teams channel.

3. clean_metadata.csv  
   - Purpose: Contains the gold standard metadata for validation. Avaliable on the Teams channel.

---

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Download ollama and install the .exe file** from following <https://ollama.com/download/>

3. **Install Models**

`ollama pull mistral`

4. **Run Mistral model**  
`ollama run mistral`

5. **Run the pipeline**  
`python main.py`

---

## Evaulation Mode

To evaluate the accuracy of the pipeline:

1.	**Place gold test PDFs in data/gold_files/**

2.	**Ensure gold metadata file exists at data/lookups/clean_metadata.csv**

3.	**Run:**
`python evaluate.py`

This will:

- Run the pipeline using gold input files
- Save processed files in data/evaluation/output/
- Log output metadata in data/evaluation/evaluation_log.csv
- Compute and print F1, precision and recall scores for:
   - Duplicate detection (yes vs no)
   - Site Registry Releasable (yes vs no)

Evaluation output is self-contained and does not modify your main output/logs folders.


## Output

Each processed PDF will appear in `outputs/Site_ID/YYYY-DOC_TYPE/` with a new standardized filename. A CSV log is created at `logs/metadata_log.csv` during normal runs, and at `evaluation/evaluation_log.csv` during evaluation mode. The log contains the following fields:

- Original_Filename            → Name of the original input PDF
- New_Filename                 → Standardized renamed file
- Site_id                      → 4-digit Site ID (from filename or LLM)
- Document_Type                → Classified type of the document
- Site_Registry_Releaseable    → "yes", "no" or "no (duplicate)", if ready for public release
- Title                        → Full document or report title
- Receiver                     → Person or organization the document is addressed to
- Sender                       → Person or organization that authored/submitted the document
- Address                      → Site or project location
- Duplicate                    → "yes" if flagged as a duplicate, otherwise "no"
- Readable                     → "yes" if the document was mostly readable, otherwise "no"
- Output_Path                  → Full path to the renamed file in the output directory

---

## Notes

- Raw PDFs are never modified
- The LLM is only used when metadata is incomplete or ambiguous
- Document types are inferred using keyword matching
- To use the ML classifier, set USE_ML_CLASSIFIER = True in main.py

This is an early prototype to demonstrate pipeline automation and reproducibility.
