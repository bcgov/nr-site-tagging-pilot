      "As requested, Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder) have carried out an electromagnetic terrain \n",
      "conductivity survey (EM-31) at the Okanagan University College campus (OUC) on \n",
      "K.L.O. Road in Kelowna, BC (Figures 1 and 2). The objective of the survey was to \n",
      "delineate buried oxbow channels that were in-filled with landfill debris and, in particular, \n",
      "to locate potentially hazardous targets on the scale of isolated metallic storage tanks and \n",
      "55 gallon drums, particularly within the soccer field area. The geophysical investigation \n",
      "excluded the eastern quarter of the campus (east of Lot 39 in Figure 3) since the former \n",
      "City of Kelowna Landfill (operated until the 1960’s) never included this eastern area. \n",
      "The survey consisted of two areas as shown in Figure 2:\n",
      "1. \n",
      "the initial area of interest, the northern half of Lot 39 (Figure 3) encompassing the \n",
      "present soccer field, is the site of the proposed Kelowna Secondary School (KSS) \n",
      "sports field; and\n",
      "2. \n",
      "the secondary area of interest consists of the majority of the remaining \n",
      "three-quarters of the OUC campus.\n",
      "Outside of the KSS site the survey was optimized with a lower station density to provide \n",
      "the desired coverage at a spatial resolution sufficient to locate most of the possible \n",
      "isolated drum-like targets. Interpretation of the resulting contoured data indicated \n",
      "different areas, or concentrations, of landfill debris, including buried metal and possibly \n",
      "impacted soil to approximately 5.6 m depth.\n",
      "Fieldwork for this investigation was conducted by Rob Luzitano, a Golder geophysicist, \n",
      "from August 4 to 10, 1999. This report summarizes the methods and results of the \n",
      "investigation.\n",
      "2 .0 METHODOLOGY AND SURVEY\n",
      "A clear definition of survey objectives dictates the geophysical methodology to be \n",
      "carried-out. Initially, a Geonics EM-61 survey (a depth-focused metal detector with a \n",
      "3.5m investigation range) was considered for locating exclusively buried metal, \n",
      "particularly drum-sized targets. Since delineating impacted soil and detecting buried \n",
      "non-metallic debris was also of interest an EM conductivity survey was chosen. \n",
      "Selection of appropriate instrumentation also involves a trade-off between depth of \n",
      "investigation and spatial resolution. In general, depth of investigation increases with coil \n",
      "Golder Associates\n",
      "October 21, 1999\n",
      "-2-\n",
      "992-1897\n",
      "separation (Section 2.1) and decreases with frequency. Spatial resolution, however, is \n",
      "improved by decreasing the intercoil spacing and, consequently the volume of soil over \n",
      "which a given reading is averaged.\n",
      "Resolution is defined as the ability to discriminate a target from the background variation \n",
      "or from a neighboring “target.” The concern in this survey is to discriminate from the \n",
      "background variation. Resolution depends primarily on four factors:\n",
      "1. \n",
      "electrical size, i.e., the combination of the target’s physical size and contrast from \n",
      "the host material;\n",
      "2. \n",
      "depth of burial;\n",
      "3. \n",
      "coil spacing; and\n",
      "4. \n",
      "station spacing.\n",
      "Due to this combination of factors, resolution is difficult to quantify with a single value \n",
      "for a given survey. For a metallic target expected to produce a relatively clear response, \n",
      "such as a 55 gallon drum, resolution may depend more on the station spacing. In this \n",
      "case the station spacing of an EM-31 survey should be on the order of 1 to 2 times the \n",
      "target size to ensure adequate sampling to readily resolve the metallic target. The \n",
      "expected resolution for the survey reported here, with 1 m station spacing, is such that an \n",
      "isolated 55 gallon drum-like target, buried in a vertical orientation, could be located on \n",
      "the reference grid within an approximately 3 m hemispherical radius.\n",
      "The survey reported here was carried-out using a Geonics EM-31 which provides an \n",

Golder have carried out an electromagnetic terrain conductivity survey EM-31 at the Okanagan University College campus OUC on K.L.O. Road in Kelowna, BC Figures 1 and 2. The objective of the survey was to delineate buried oxbow channels that were in-filled with landfill debris and, in particular, to locate potentially hazardous targets on the scale of isolated metallic storage tanks and 55 gallon drums, particularly within the soccer field area. The geophysical investigation excluded the eastern quarter of the campus east of Lot 39 in Figure 3 since the former City of Kelowna Landfill operated until the 1960s never included this eastern area. The survey consisted of two areas as shown in Figure 2: 1. the initial area of interest, the northern half of Lot 39 Figure 3 encompassing the present soccer field, is the site of the proposed Kelowna Secondary School KSS sports field and 2. the secondary area of interest consists of the majority of the remaining three-quarters of the OUC campus. Outside of the KSS site the survey was optimized with a lower station density to provide the desired coverage at a spatial resolution sufficient to locate most of the possible isolated drum-like targets. Interpretation of the resulting contoured data indicated different areas, or concentrations, of landfill debris, including buried metal and possibly impacted soil to approximately 5.6 m depth. Fieldwork for this investigation was conducted by Rob Luzitano, a Golder geophysicist, from August 4 to 10, 1999. This report summarizes the methods and results of the investigation. 2 .0 METHODOLOGY AND SURVEY A clear definition of survey objectives dictates the geophysical methodology to be carried-out. Initially, a Geonics EM-61 survey a depth-focused metal detector with a 3.5m investigation range was considered for locating exclusively buried metal, particularly drum-sized targets. Since delineating impacted soil and detecting buried non-metallic debris was also of interest an EM conductivity survey was chosen. Selection of appropriate instrumentation also involves a trade-off between depth of investigation and spatial resolution. In general, depth of investigation increases with coil Golder Associates October 21, 1999 -2- 992-1897 separation Section 2.1 and decreases with frequency. Spatial resolution, however, is improved by decreasing the intercoil spacing and, consequently the volume of soil over which a given reading is averaged. Resolution is defined as the ability to discriminate a target from the background variation or from a neighboring target. The concern in this survey is to discriminate from the background variation. Resolution depends primarily on four factors: 1. electrical size, i.e., the combination of the targets physical size and contrast from the host material 2. depth of burial 3. coil spacing and 4. station spacing. Due to this combination of factors, resolution is difficult to quantify with a single value for a given survey. For a metallic target expected to produce a relatively clear response, such as a 55 gallon drum, resolution may depend more on the station spacing. In this case the station spacing of an EM-31 survey should be on the order of 1 to 2 times the target size to ensure adequate sampling to readily resolve the metallic target. The expected resolution for the survey reported here, with 1 m station spacing, is such that an isolated 55 gallon drum-like target, buried in a vertical orientation, could be located on the reference grid within an approximately 3 m hemispherical radius. The survey reported here was carried-out using a Geonics EM-31 which provides an approximate depth of investigation of 5.6 m. 2.1 Electromagnetic Terrain Conductivity Mapping EM-31 The Geonics EM-31 electromagnetic terrain conductivity meter measures soil conductivity from the inductive response of the ground. Basic principles of electromagnetic conductivity mapping are illustrated in Figure 4. An alternating current is supplied to a wire transmitter coil, producing a time-varying 9.8 KHz magnetic field Bp that penetrates the ground and induces electrical eddy currents Je within the subsurface materials. These eddy currents give rise to a secondary magnetic field Bs that is measured, together with the primary field, by the receiver coil. Two components of the secondary field are measured: Golder Associates\n"
