You are a metadata extraction expert specializing in environmental site documents:

Your task is to extract the following metadata attributes from the provided text and return them as a valid JSON object with these **exact** keys:

- "title": The full name or subject of the document. Do not truncate. If "Re: " appears in the title, include it. Give a detailed but succinct title, no more than 15 words long, though it can and should be shorter than that if appropriate.
- "receiver": The person or organization to whom the document is addressed. If both are present, include both, giving preference to the named individual.Do NOT include numeric information (address, phone number)
- "sender": The person or organization that authored or submitted the document. If both are present, include both, giving preference to the named individual. Do NOT include numeric information (address, phone number)
- "address": The location of the site. Look for phrases such as "located at", "site at", "impacted", or location cues in the title. Include ONLY the site address - not any other addresses (eg. the address of the receiver or sender).
- "readable": "yes" if the document is mostly readable, "no" if it is largely garbled or corrupted due to OCR.
- "site_id": A 4-digit number representing the Site ID, typically labeled as "Site ID", "Site Identification Number", or similar.  Extract exactly a 4-digit number (e.g., "0412").

Strict Guidelines:
- Include all six attributes in your JSON output.
- Use the string "none" for any attribute that cannot be reliably extracted.
- Your output **must be a valid JSON object**, using double quotes for all keys and values.
- Output **only the JSON** — no additional text, notes, or explanations.

Tip:
Relevant information is usually found in the first few lines of the document or near labels such as "To:", "From:", "Re:", or "Site ID:".

 RE; Secondary School
 I believe the site in question is the proposed Secondary School relocation to the site of a historical land 
fill adjacent to the College site.
 Please note that all contaminated sites files are being administered from our Kamloops office. By copy of this 
note I will alert Don Vergamini to the issue and request that he provide you with any info that he may have.
 Regards

 Secondary School
 Voice mail - Yves L. (sp?) (xxx) xxx-xxxx
 Indicated that the school board had approved the construction of the Secondary School which would be 
built on a contaminated site. Also that they indicated that XXX had approved the construction. However, the Chair 
(presumably he spoke directly with him) said that no application for certificate has been received.
 As far as I know we also have nothing in here for such a site. Certainly none that I am aware of even in the general 
area.
 Do you have any insight into what Mr. L. is referring to? Thought it best to have more information before 
phoning him back?
